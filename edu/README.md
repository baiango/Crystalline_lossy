## Why not [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)?
We got antitrust laws to encourage freedom and competition. GPL was restrictive in its distribution, and companies were able to get around loopholes of GPL by using it internally only.

So, I thought [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/) is the better way to boost freedom. Don't try to limit or claim your name to people if you're serious about sharing. I'm not doing ego-driven project.
